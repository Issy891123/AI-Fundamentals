# Module 1: Python Basics & Numpy/Pandas

## 📖 Module Description

This first module introduces students to the fundamental concepts of programming with Python, focusing on the data types, control structures, and core libraries essential for Artificial Intelligence and Data Science: Numpy and Pandas.

No prior programming experience is required. All lessons are hands-on and beginner-friendly.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

- Understand and use basic Python data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`)
- Create and manipulate collections such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples
- Write simple functions and use control flow (`if`, `for`, `while`)
- Perform basic mathematical operations with Numpy arrays
- Load, clean, and analyze tabular data with Pandas DataFrames
