Hi there üëã this is Andres Felipe Rojas Parra. Welcome to this learning adventure in Artificial Intelligence and Python. It is a ‚ú® special ‚ú® repository for discussing all things related to basic AI and Python.

I‚Äôve spent over 23 years in the tech world, helping teams and organizations in Colombia and Latin America grow with technology. My journey has taken me through various roles, including CTO, IT Manager, and Business Applications Leader, where I have consistently focused on innovation, teamwork, and driving meaningful change through digital transformation.

üåé Along the way, I‚Äôve had the chance to:
- üöÄ Lead AI and data projects in industries like healthcare, finance, legal, and education
- ü§ù Collaborate with global leaders like Microsoft and NVIDIA
- üìú Earn certifications in areas like MLOps (Duke University), TensorFlow professional development (Deeplearning.AI), Microsoft Azure AI, NVIDIA Deep Learning, Digital Twins, Computer Vision, and Bootstrapping
- üèÜ Support companies on their path to ethical and responsible AI adoption  
- üí° Design and implement real-world solutions using Python, Rust, cloud computing, MLOps and DevOps
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning Computer Vision for NVidia Jetson Nano, Jetson Nano Orin Nano Super, and Raspberry Pi 4/5
- üí¨ Ask me about C++, C#, Python, Rust, and R for Data Science and AI/ML/NN/LLM/RAG/NLP & GEN AI

What excites me the most is helping others discover the power of technology ‚Äî no matter where you‚Äôre starting from.  


Learning should be hands-on, collaborative, and fun. I‚Äôm here to guide you, answer your questions, and make sure you feel supported every step of the way.

This course is for everyone ‚Äî whether you‚Äôre new to coding or curious about AI. Let‚Äôs explore, create, and learn together! üå±‚ú®
